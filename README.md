# Vulkan Level Viewer
This is a custom level viewer built under the direction of Full Sail University.

It uses the vulkan api, and gateware as tools to view a level loaded with meshes and materials.

To clone the repo use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hiiii5/LevelViewer.git` to properly download gateware.
The vulkan sdk must be installed from: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home

To begin, run the build.cmd and then run.cmd to start visual studio.

The viewer is built with this architecture plan in mind:
